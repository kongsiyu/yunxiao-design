## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey Sue! 🦞 Yunxiao 云效 here, ready to help you build that 云效 skill. What are we tackling today — digging into the API docs, scaffolding the skill structure, or something else entirely?
